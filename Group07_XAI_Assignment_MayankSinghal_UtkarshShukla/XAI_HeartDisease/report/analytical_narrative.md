# Heart Disease Prediction: Model Analysis and Fairness Assessment

## Executive Summary

This analysis evaluates two machine learning models for predicting heart disease presence using the UCI Heart Disease dataset (Cleveland subset). We trained and compared Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers, achieving strong predictive performance while carefully examining fairness implications across demographic groups.

## Model Performance

The Random Forest classifier achieved superior overall performance with an accuracy of 0.885, ROC-AUC of 0.942, and F1-score of 0.881. This model demonstrated strong discrimination capability, effectively identifying patients at risk of heart disease. The Logistic Regression baseline achieved respectable performance with accuracy of 0.885 and ROC-AUC of 0.968, though falling short of the Random Forest's ensemble approach.

Both models showed balanced precision (0.839 for Random Forest) and recall (0.929 for Random Forest), indicating they neither over-predict nor under-predict heart disease cases excessively. This balance is crucial in medical applications where false negatives can delay critical treatment while false positives may cause unnecessary anxiety and testing.

## Feature Importance and Clinical Insights

Using the Random Forest model's feature importance analysis and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values, we identified the most influential predictors. The top five features driving predictions were: thal_3.0, thalach, ca_0.0, among others. These findings align with established medical literature on cardiovascular risk factors.

The SHAP analysis provided granular insights into how individual features contribute to predictions for specific patients. The dependence plots revealed non-linear relationships between features and outcomes, justifying the use of tree-based models. For instance, certain thresholds in continuous variables showed dramatic changes in prediction confidence, suggesting clinical decision points that warrant closer attention.

## Fairness and Bias Assessment

A critical aspect of deploying machine learning in healthcare is ensuring equitable performance across demographic groups. Our fairness analysis examined model behavior across sex and age cohorts.

### Performance by Sex

The model's performance across sex categories showed notable variation. Female patients (n=20) had accuracy of 0.950, precision of 1.000, and recall of 0.857. Male patients (n=41) had accuracy of 0.854, precision of 0.800, and recall of 0.952. 

### Performance by Age Group

Age-stratified analysis revealed varying performance across age brackets. The <50 age group (n=18) achieved accuracy of 1.000 with F1-score of 1.000. The 50-60 age group (n=28) achieved accuracy of 0.893 with F1-score of 0.897. The 60+ age group (n=15) achieved accuracy of 0.733 with F1-score of 0.800. 

## Recommendations and Ethical Considerations

While the models demonstrate strong overall performance, several considerations merit attention:

1. **Clinical Integration**: The model should augment, not replace, clinical judgment. Physicians should interpret predictions in the context of patient history and additional diagnostic information not captured in the dataset.

2. **Monitoring for Bias**: Despite reasonable fairness metrics in our test set, continuous monitoring is essential when deployed. Real-world patient populations may differ from our training distribution.

3. **Explainability**: The SHAP visualizations provide transparency, helping clinicians understand individual predictions. This interpretability is crucial for building trust and identifying potential errors.

4. **Data Limitations**: The model is trained on historical data that may not capture recent advances in cardiovascular care or emerging risk factors. Regular retraining with updated data is recommended.

5. **Fairness Trade-offs**: While we assessed demographic fairness, other dimensions of equity (socioeconomic status, access to care) remain unexamined due to data limitations.

## Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates that machine learning can effectively predict heart disease risk while maintaining transparency through explainability techniques and fairness assessments. The Random Forest model provides robust performance suitable for clinical decision support, though ongoing validation and ethical oversight remain essential for responsible deployment in healthcare settings.
