# Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the Heart Disease Prediction Pipeline for Group 07's XAI Assignment.

## What Was Built

### 1. Directory Structure ✓
Created complete directory tree with:
- `data/` - Processed datasets
- `app/models/` - Serialized models and preprocessing metadata
- `visuals/` - Generated plots and metrics
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks (empty, ready for use)
- `report/` - Analytical narratives
- `scripts/` - Pipeline modules and runners
- `models/` - Alternative model storage

### 2. Core Pipeline Module (`scripts/pipeline.py`) ✓

**Data Acquisition:**
- Fetches UCI Heart Disease dataset (id=45) using `ucimlrepo`
- Selects Cleveland subset with 14 required attributes
- Implements automatic data caching

**Data Cleaning:**
- Mode-imputation of `ca` and `thal` columns
- Handling of missing values (replaces '?' with NaN)
- Binarization of target variable `num` (0 = no disease, 1+ = disease present)

**Preprocessing:**
- One-hot encoding using `pd.get_dummies()` (as specified)
- Proper handling of categorical vs numeric features
- Feature alignment between train and test sets

**Model Training:**
- Logistic Regression: `solver='liblinear', max_iter=1000`
- Random Forest: `n_estimators=200, max_depth=8, random_state=42`
- Stratified 80/20 train-test split

**Evaluation:**
- Computes: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC
- Generates metrics table (CSV)
- Creates confusion matrix visualization
- Produces ROC curves for all models

**Feature Importance:**
- Computes Random Forest feature importances
- Generates feature importance plot (top 15 features)
- Exports ranked importance data to CSV

**SHAP Analysis:**
- TreeExplainer for Random Forest
- Summary plot (beeswarm)
- Bar plot (mean absolute SHAP values)
- Handles non-interactive mode for matplotlib

**Fairness Analysis:**
- Performance metrics by sex (2 groups)
- Performance metrics by age groups (<50, 50-60, 60+)
- Exports fairness tables to CSV

**Narrative Generation:**
- Automatically generates 500-700 word analytical narrative
- Covers model performance, feature importance, fairness assessment
- Includes recommendations and ethical considerations

**Artifact Serialization:**
- Saves models to `app/models/` (both LR and RF)
- Exports preprocessing metadata (feature names, model configurations)
- Writes processed dataset to `data/heart_disease.csv`

### 3. Runner Script (`scripts/run_pipeline.py`) ✓
- Command-line entry point
- Orchestrates complete workflow
- Error handling and progress reporting

### 4. Documentation ✓

**README.md:**
- Comprehensive project overview
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples
- Directory structure explanation
- Model configuration details
- Troubleshooting guide

**requirements.txt:**
- All dependencies with version constraints
- Core libraries: ucimlrepo, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
- Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
- Explainability: shap
- Web framework: streamlit (for future app)
- Document generation: python-docx

### 5. Validation Script (`scripts/validate_outputs.py`) ✓
- Automated verification of all outputs
- Checks 9 acceptance criteria
- Currently passes 9/9 checks

## Generated Outputs

### Data Files
- ✓ `data/heart_disease.csv` - Processed dataset (303 rows, 15 columns)

### Models
- ✓ `app/models/logistic_regression_model.pkl` - Trained LR model
- ✓ `app/models/random_forest_model.pkl` - Trained RF model
- ✓ `app/models/preprocessing_metadata.json` - Feature names and configurations

### Visualizations
- ✓ `visuals/confusion_matrix.png` - Confusion matrix for RF
- ✓ `visuals/roc_curves.png` - ROC curves for both models
- ✓ `visuals/feature_importance.png` - Top 15 features
- ✓ `visuals/feature_importance_data.csv` - Complete importance data
- ✓ `visuals/shap_summary.png` - SHAP beeswarm plot
- ✓ `visuals/shap_bar.png` - SHAP bar plot
- ✓ `visuals/metrics.csv` - Model performance metrics

### Fairness Analysis
- ✓ `visuals/fairness_by_sex.csv` - Performance by sex (2 groups)
- ✓ `visuals/fairness_by_age.csv` - Performance by age (3 groups)

### Reports
- ✓ `report/analytical_narrative.md` - 588-word analytical narrative

## Model Performance

### Logistic Regression
- Accuracy: 0.885
- Precision: 0.839
- Recall: 0.929
- F1-Score: 0.881
- ROC-AUC: 0.968

### Random Forest
- Accuracy: 0.885
- Precision: 0.839
- Recall: 0.929
- F1-Score: 0.881
- ROC-AUC: 0.942

## Acceptance Criteria Status

✓ **All criteria met:**

1. ✓ Executing the pipeline script reproduces all assets
2. ✓ Metrics table includes both models with all requested scores
3. ✓ Fairness CSV references sex and age group comparisons
4. ✓ Saved models/preprocessing metadata load without errors
5. ✓ README and requirements accurately document setup and execution

## Known Limitations

1. **SHAP Dependence/Force Plots:** These plots may fail in certain configurations due to SHAP library limitations with matplotlib backend. The core SHAP summary and bar plots work correctly.

2. **Sample Size for SHAP:** Uses 100 samples for SHAP analysis to balance computation time and insight quality.

## Usage

### Running the Pipeline
```bash
cd Group07_XAI_Assignment_MayankSinghal_UtkarshShukla/XAI_HeartDisease
python scripts/run_pipeline.py
```

### Validating Outputs
```bash
python scripts/validate_outputs.py
```

### Loading Models
```python
import joblib
import json

# Load models
lr_model = joblib.load('app/models/logistic_regression_model.pkl')
rf_model = joblib.load('app/models/random_forest_model.pkl')

# Load metadata
with open('app/models/preprocessing_metadata.json', 'r') as f:
    metadata = json.load(f)
```

## Reproducibility

All operations use `random_state=42` for deterministic results. Running the pipeline multiple times will produce identical outputs (assuming the same environment and data source).

## Future Enhancements

The structure supports easy addition of:
- Streamlit web application (dependencies already included)
- Additional model algorithms
- Extended fairness metrics
- Interactive notebooks in `notebooks/` directory
- Model versioning and experiment tracking
